These helper scripts are intended to make using the Confluent Kafka CLI slightly easier by including options and settings that are always used. Instead of needing to always copy-paste the full connection strings, key type, etc. they are all included in the wrappers. The .ccloud/*.config files follow the Confluent Key conventions.

The Confluent Kafka Platform running locally is required for `local` usage. Check the Confluent Documentation for latest versions and any changes to setup steps.
